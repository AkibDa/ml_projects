# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Price Prediction using ZenML and MLflow
The project is focused of building an end-to-end machine larning pipeline for a **house price prediction system**.
The pipeline is developed using **ZenML, a MLOps framework** that helps in managing machine learning workflows, and **MLflow**, which is used for experiment tracking and model deployment.
The **primary goal** is to predict house prices based on various features of the properties, such as the size, location, and condition
